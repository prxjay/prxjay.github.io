Hey mates! I'm excited to share that I've designed the layout of my portfolio website from scratch using Bootstrap as a starting point. I then customized it extensively using HTML and CSS to match my unique requirements and added various personalized elements. It's been an amazing experience putting my creativity to work! Feel free to check out the original Bootstrap framework, which is licensed under the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE].
